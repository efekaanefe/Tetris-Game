# Tetris-Game
python/pygame

PROS:
Pieces get faster depending on level (level system depends on how many pieces came to the game)(i.e. after every 10 pieces level increases +1)(not a pro or con)
Keeps your best score in a .txt file
Soundtrack and clear-line-effect included


CONS:
Pieces are inactivated immediately after touching
When moving a piece left/right, clock keeps ticking which limits possible piece end-locations
No animation
Rotation system doesnÂ´t allow to rotate a piece that is at the edge, it would be better if it allows but shifts the piece a little
